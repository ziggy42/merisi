#Meirisi

Merisi is an Android application that let the user get new wallpapers (taken from the awesome website [wallhaven](http://alpha.wallhaven.cc/)  ) and manage his library.

***
This application is currently not available on Google Play, because Google removed it due to IP problems. I don't really know why they removed my app so, if you think to have an answer, please contact me.
